# News-Event-Classifier
As elections are near approaching, there will be numerous events happening in countries like India, Indonesia and Thailand. We are focusing on the events, which will bring social unrest in the society such as Riots or Protests, which can possibly influence the elections. Since, the lengthy news articles are not very engaging enough, people lost the habit of news reading or following up with the current affairs. Our goal is to provide hand curated, short and crisp news preserving the original content. We are also providing tags such as event_location, event_date, parties/organizations involved so that it becomes easy for the end user to pick relevant content.
